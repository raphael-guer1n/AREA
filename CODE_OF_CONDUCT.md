1. Document the facts (date, place, conversation, participants).
2. Contact the project lead or the teaching staff as soon as possible.
3. If needed, pause your participation until the situation is clarified.

Reports will be handled discreetly, and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure safety and respect for everyone.
